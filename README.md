# Fun Facts

The MERN stack project consists of four subprojects, each serving different functionalities to create an interactive web application. The main goal of the project is to provide users with fun facts to read, allow them to upload and store personal URLs, and give the owner the ability to manage fun facts and uploaded URLs through a locally hosted React application.

This app consists of four parts. This is the part 1 of the Fun Facts Web App.

## Part 1: React App (Fun Facts Management)

This subproject is a React application hosted locally on the owner's PC. Its primary purpose is to enable the owner to upload and manage fun facts that users can read on the web application. As the owner, you have exclusive access to this React app, giving you full control over the fun facts displayed to the users.
